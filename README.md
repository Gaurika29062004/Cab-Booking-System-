# Cab Booking System

A C++ console-based cab booking system demonstrating **data structures, graph algorithms, and file handling**.  

---

## Features

- Add, list, and manage **cabs** with unique IDs and drivers.
- Book rides based on **nearest available cab** using **Dijkstra's shortest path**.
- End rides, calculate **distance and fare**, and mark cabs as available.
- Track **active and completed rides** with full ride paths.
- Persistent storage using `cabs.txt` to save and load cab data.
- Fully connected graph of **nodes 0â€“9** to avoid unreachable destinations.
- Neatly formatted tables with **borders** for all listings.

## File Structure
| File/Folder              | Description                                     |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `cab_booking_system.cpp` | Main C++ source code for the cab booking system |
| `cabs.txt`               | Stores persistent cab information               |
| `graph.txt`              | (Optional) Stores road connections if needed    |
| `README.md`              | Project documentation (this file)               |
| `build/`                 | Folder to store compiled binaries               |

## Future Enhancements

GUI integration for better user experience.

Dynamic fare calculation based on time of day and traffic simulation.

Multiple cab types (standard, premium) with different fare rates.

Integration with a database for real-time multi-user simulation.
